My profile:
    My name is Sathwik Marupaka.I am a Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) student at George Washington University (GWU), specializing in Machine Intelligence and Cognition. I have a strong background in Generative AI, including Large Language Models, multi-agent systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and model fine-tuning workflows.

Key Skills:
Python, C, SQL
TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, LlamaIndex
RAG, LoRA, LLM Fine-Tuning, Prompt Engineering
Vector Databases: ChromaDB, Pinecone
Cloud: AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda), Google Cloud
Developer Tools: Docker, Git, Streamlit, Selenium, REST APIs

Key Projects:

1. Multi-Agent Financial Research System: Engineered an autonomous multi-agent AI system for collaborative financial analysis on public companies. Used Python, LangChain, Llama-3, Tavily API, and ChromaDB to enable a Researcher agent (real-time data gathering) and Summarizer agent (insight distillation) with an interactive Streamlit UI.

2. Code Generation Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuned a 7B CodeLlama LLM using LoRA on competitive programming Python datasets, achieving a 15% improvement in code correctness (HumanEval). Designed efficient pipelines for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
 
Professional Experience:

    Microsoft Engage Mentorship: Built and optimized a movie recommendation system (Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML) that increased user engagement by 25% via advanced content similarity logic.

Education:

    George Washington University, MSCS (2026 expected) | Relevant Coursework: AI, ML, Algorithms

I   ndian Institute of Technology/ISM Dhanbad, BTech in Electronics & Communications (2024)
